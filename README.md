VideoIntake_ParkStar
====================

This is a Java-written program I created to take selections from customers and make a PDF copy of it for the workers at the attraction, so they can prepare the customer's request.

This program was written for an video karaoke service called "Park Star", located in Six Flags America, Mitchellville, MD.

It let's the customer put in their name, email, stage name, video backdrop (a type of video to replace the green screen), name of song, and number of DVDs. Once the customer finishes, a PDF is created and sent to the network drive for the workers to see the order.
